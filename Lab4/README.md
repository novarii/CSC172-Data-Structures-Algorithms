# CSC172 Lab: URLinkedList Implementation

## Name: Eray Bozoglu

---

## Lab Overview

This lab implements a doubly linked list data structure called URLinkedList. The implementation includes various methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements in the list, as well as utility methods like subList and toArray. The lab demonstrates understanding of linked data structures and their operations.

## File Contents

- `URLinkedList.java`: Contains the main implementation of the doubly linked list.
- `URLinkedListTest.java`: Includes unit tests for the URLinkedList implementation.

## Test Cases

I ran the following test cases to verify the correctness of my implementation:

1. Adding elements (add, addAll)
2. Retrieving elements (get)
3. Removing elements
4. Replacing elements (set)
5. Creating a sublist
6. Converting to array
7. Peek and poll operations

The test method prints "FAILED" messages only when a test doesn't produce the expected result. If no failure messages are printed, all tests have passed successfully.
