### Lab Synopsis

This lab focuses on reviewing Java programming concepts and introducing generics. The main objectives are:

1. Implement and understand generic methods for printing arrays and finding maximum values
2. Explore the use of lambda functions

The lab demonstrates the flexibility and type safety provided by Java generics, allowing for the creation of reusable code that works with different data types. It also touches on functional interfaces and lambda expressions, showcasing modern Java programming techniques.
