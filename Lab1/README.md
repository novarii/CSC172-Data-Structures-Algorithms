Lab Synopsis:
This lab focuses on reviewing Java programming concepts and introducing generics. 
The main objectives are to implement and understand generic methods for printing arrays and finding maximum values, as well as to explore the use of lambda functions. 
The lab demonstrates the flexibility and type safety provided by Java generics, allowing for the creation of reusable code that works with different data types. 
It also touches on functional interfaces and lambda expressions, showcasing modern Java programming techniques.
File Contents:
LabOne.java: Contains the main implementation of generic methods for printing arrays and finding maximum values.
LabOneFn.java: Demonstrates the use of lambda functions with a focus on finding the maximum character in an array.
OUTPUT: Provides compilation and execution instructions for both Java files, including expected output.
